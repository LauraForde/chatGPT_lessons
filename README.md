# Asking ChatCPT for Go Tasks

I will be using this repo to track tasks I have asked ChatGPT to generate to aid in my learning of the language.

## Beginner Tasks
1. Hello, World!
    * Write a program to write "Hello, World!" to the console.
    * Modify it to accept a user input and print "Hello, []!".
2. Basic Arithemtic Calculator
    * Create a program that takes two numbers from the user and preforms basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
